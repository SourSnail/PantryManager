# PantryManager
 Overall Purpose of the Program: The program aims to assist in managing a pantry by allowing the user to input ingredients until they enter "done". After that, it compares the entered ingredients with the pre-defined pantry ingredients and prints out which ingredients are not present in the pantry.
